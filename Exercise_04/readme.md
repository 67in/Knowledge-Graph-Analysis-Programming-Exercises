# Tensors and Tensor Factorization Techniques

<img align="right" src="http://sda.cs.uni-bonn.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Smart-Data-Analytics.png" width="250px" />

This exercise is an introduction to tensors and latent representation. We start with the introduction to latent features using SVD. We see how it can be used to solve problems like recommender system. Further we extend the idea of matrix factorization to tensors and discuss CP and RESCAL to find latent representation of tensors.
