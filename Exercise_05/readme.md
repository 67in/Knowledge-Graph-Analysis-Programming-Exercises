This exercise is an introduction to deep learning framework pytorch and Bilinear RESCAL. Pytorch is a state of the art deep learning framework very common among researchers. We will use it for this exercise and upcoming ones. The exercise starts with the basic introduction to pytorch followed with the implementation of RESCAL. We will use SGD as an optimizer.
