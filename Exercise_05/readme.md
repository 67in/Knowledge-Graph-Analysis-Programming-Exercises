<img align="right" src="http://sda.cs.uni-bonn.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Smart-Data-Analytics.png" width="250px" />

This exercise is an introduction to deep learning framework pytorch and Bilinear RESCAL. Pytorch is a state of the art deep learning framework very common among researchers. We will use it for this exercise and upcoming ones. There are two notebooks one is an introduction to pytorch and second is an implementation of RESCAL. It is highly recommended to look at pytorch introduction before proceeding with RESCAL exercise.
